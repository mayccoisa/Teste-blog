          <h1>From MOBA to Action-Platformer – How Convergence: A League of Legends Adapted Zaun’s Champions</h1>
          <p class="text">My name is Eric Angelillo, I’m the Creative Director and Co-Art Director for Convergence: A League of Legends Story. I also co-founded Double Stallion games 10 years ago with a mission to create vibrant & transcendent experiences with players all around the world. I love making bold action games with vibrant stylized visuals inspired by the very best of animation and comics.

            Convergence: A League of Legends Story, is our new, story-driven, single-player 2D action platformer featuring dynamic combat and unique exploration, and it gave us an incredible opportunity to use our strengths as a studio adapt a myriad of Zaun and Piltover Champions from the original League of Legends MOBA. With Ekko as our lead, it was difficult to narrow down the list of other Champs we wanted to include in the cast, but we settled on Warwick, Camille and of course, Jinx the Loose Cannon!
            
            For Ekko, development really started with one key drawing I made of him grinding on a rail. I knew that a game about Ekko had to double down on not only his time rewind abilities and boy genius aspects, but also on his punk-inspired fashion sense. The concept in question had a strong graffiti aesthetic and pushed Ekko into a neon soaked post-punk skater vibe. This became the basis for which we built the whole game’s art direction..</p>


            <p class="text">We opted to stick close to Ekko’s classic design from League, but adapted his design shape language to include a lot of triangles and sharp angles. Astute observers will even notice that his silhouette is based on an hourglass shape. His shoes were slightly modified to allow for strong arches allowing him to grind. Mechanics-wise, we adapted Ekko’s entire kit of abilities and then some!

            Building a single-player game free of PVP balancing allowed us to really leverage Ekko’s ability to rewind time, so this naturally became our core mechanic. But players will be thrilled to see his MOBA abilities – the Timewinder, Parallel Convergence, Phase Dive and Chronobreak – are also integral parts of the game. In addition to faithfully adapting these moves, we also expanded on them by making them useful outside of combat as well. The Timewinder can be used to power electrical sockets, Parallel Convergence can time-freeze collapsing platforms and Phase Dive can be used to teleport through walls!</p>

            <p class="text">
              A story about Zaun wouldn’t be the same without a visit to the Sump… and a visit to the Sump wouldn’t be complete without its resident Uncaged Wrath; Warwick. Warwick was one of the first Champions we explored through concept art as his biomechanical wolf profile is just so fun to draw. His sheer sprite size and complexity made him one of the most intensive characters to animate in the game, but we knew it would be worth the extra effort.

              Moveset-wise; our animators referenced the look of his abilities like Jaws of the Beast and Primal Howl. We even adapted his leaping Ultimate; Infinite Duress, but instead of slashes, we had him grab Ekko and throw him against a wall! Of course, Ekko can just rewind it every time… provided he has enough Rewind Charges in his Zero Drive left.

              Camille the Steel Shadow is an integral part of Convergence. She represents Piltover in the game, and acts as an unlikely ally to Ekko as they are both seeking to take down the malicious Chembaron family known as the Poingdestres. Although Camille eventually becomes an ally, things initially start on the wrong foot between her and Ekko… Fans will be thrilled to know they will have to face Camille in hand-to-hand combat.

              Part of why we chose to adapt Camille is that her moveset from League of Legends had so much potential in a side-scrolling game. Camille’s signature hookshots are used in League to quickly move laterally, however, in an action-platformer like Convergence, we were able to use the hookshots to allow Camille to have incredible aerial abilities. As a result, her battle encounter requires Ekko to really dodge deftly, as Camille dominates the arena with both horizontal and vertical high mobility.

              In addition to the speed and agility afforded by her hookshots, League players will notice we also adapted Camille’s Precision Protocol roundhouse kick. And of course, who could forget Camille’s Ultimate attack; The Hextech Ultimatum. While we had to adapt the Ultimatum’s barriers to function vertically, the essence of capturing her opponents in a Hextech matrix remains the same. For Camille’s art, we really pushed her key features; deadly, tall, bladed legs and refined Piltovan elegance. As previously mentioned, we used triangular shapes as a motif for our character designs, and this is especially evident with Camille’s sharp figure.
